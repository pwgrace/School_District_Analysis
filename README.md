# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
#### The purpose of this analysis is to remove Thomas High School 9th grade test scores from the original analysis, and fix errors that that then creates. The original focus of this analysis was to examine 15 schools and compare their performance based on: School Type, Size, Budget, and Average Math and Reading scores. 
## Results
### How is the district summary affected? 
##### The total students decreased, as well as all scores except for the Average Reading Score. It should be noted that we were instructed to decrease the total students in the district summary but keep the same student number in the school summary below.

### How is the school summary affected?
##### It should be noted that we were instructed to keep the same number of Total students at Thomas High School so the percentages will not be exact. The intermediate scores are after the scores were removed but before the updated scores were normalized.
